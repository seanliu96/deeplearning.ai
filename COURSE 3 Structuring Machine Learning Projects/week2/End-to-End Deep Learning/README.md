## What Is End-to-End Deep Learning

>End-to-end deep learning is the simplification of a processing or learning systems into one neural network. End-to-end deep learning cannot be used for every problem since it needs a lot of labeled data.

### Speech Recognition Models

- The traditional way - small data set

  audio—>extract features—>phonemes—>words—>transcript

- The hybrid way - medium data set

  audio—>phonemes—>words—>transcript

- The End-to-End deep learning way - large data set

  audio—>transcript

## Whether to Use End-to-End Learning

Pros

- Let data speak
- Less hand-desining of components needed

Cons

- May need large amount of data
- Excludes potentially useful hand-designed components
