**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), [shahariarrabby/deeplearning.ai.git](https://github.com/shahariarrabby/deeplearning.ai), [Kulbear/deep-learning-coursera.git](https://github.com/Kulbear/deep-learning-coursera), and my own work :D.

This repo is aim to help me and another students who are interested in deep learning study easily. For one thing, it is a good collection of materials. For another, it is a good place to discuss together. I add my solutions **for reference only**. I hope all of you can start quickly and improve your abilities and skills.

## There is all the `ipynb` notebook and slides that associated with <a href="http://deeplearning.ai">deeplearning.ai</a>
* **All data files added**
* **All slide added**

## Pre Trained Models
**GitHub only allows to share file less than 50mb. There is some pre-trained model like resnet etc. Suggest you to download them from shahariarrabby's [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_HDHpsm_bIOkdo7aVkOcLsYxejilRujv) or download them from online (as they are so popular you can easily get them)**
